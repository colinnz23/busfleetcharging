# Electric Bus Fleet Charging
This repository contains the poster I created as part of my Summer Research Scholarship (SRS) project at the University of Auckland. It gives a general overview of what the project involved.
This project was funded by EVisi and is owned by EVisi. Therefore I cannot publicly share the code.
  
Some things that I worked on that aren't included in the poster are:  
More constraints that reflect the real-world. Allowing for user-defined fixed profiles. Ghost vehicles which are used to estimate the arrival of new busses in the model. Use of volume and demand pricing in the objective.
